                <h2> Safety </h2>
                  <p>
                    For everyone's safety and well-being, we only allow 160 people in the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, the order is determined by the ticket(s) you receive. These tickets are given out between 8AM and 11AM, which is when the Main Room is opened. Make sure to arrive closer to 8AM to ensure an earlier spot in line. After receiving your tickets, you will be able to leave to browse the rest of the sale or get coffee. Please return to the line prior to your number being called, or you will forfeit your spot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Upon entering the Main Room, customers are permitted to purchase up to 12 books. Following this, customers should make their way to the east door to make their purchases. If you wish to buy more, you must rejoin the line, using your second ticket. This limit will continue past noon, if a line remains outside.
